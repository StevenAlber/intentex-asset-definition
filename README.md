# IntentEx Asset Class Definition

**Status:** Public Release — Foundational Economic Doctrine  
**Author:** Steven Alber  
**Date:** June 2025  
**Repository:** https://github.com/StevenAlber/intentex-asset-definition

## 🌐 Overview

This repository contains the **world’s first formal definition of intent** as a sovereign asset class. Structured through the IntentEx protocol, these documents establish the foundational legal, economic, and ontological basis for treating **verified human intent** as a licensable, cryptographically valid, post-material asset.

> Thought is no longer a metaphor. It is an asset.

- [IntentEx_Asset_Class_Definition_v1.0.pdf](./IntentEx_Asset_Class_Definition_v1.0.pdf)

## 🔍 Inside the Documents

- Ontological and legal basis for intent-as-asset

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Intent has never been recognized, licensed, or protected as an asset.  
We now define it — structurally, verifiably, and sovereignly.
