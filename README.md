## 🌐 Overview

This repository contains the **world’s first formal definition of intent** as a sovereign asset class.  
Structured through the IntentEx protocol, these documents establish the foundational legal, economic, and ontological basis for treating **verified human intent** as a licensable, cryptographically valid, post-material asset.

> Thought is no longer a metaphor. It is an asset.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Intent has never been recognized, licensed, or protected as an asset.  
We now define it — structurally, verifiably, and sovereignly.
